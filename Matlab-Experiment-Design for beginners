How to start:
If you want to present an experiment using Matlab, you will need a Toolbox (a set of commands and subfuntions), that is able to present stimuli and that is able to insure the timing of the presentation.
The toolbox most common is the Psychtoolbox. The Psychtoolbox is a Toolbox for Matlab, created to show visual or auditory stimuli in an experiment. 
http://psychtoolbox.org/

The Psychtoolbox does NOT offer a user interface (like PsychoPy). It will require basic understanding of code and the logic behind programming. 
Basics

The basis for programming with Matlab can be learnt in the Tutorials of Mathworks (Matlab). Here you can get a basic understanding of the logic of Matlab. E.g. the use of arrays etc.

The important functions
The next step to your first experiment is to understand the most important functions of the Psychtoolbox. I recommend the talks of Volodimir B. Bogdanov:

And the talks of jianglab:

Both talkers provide scripts for the experiments they try to explain. They are helpful to understand the basic logic behind loops etc.
